Hiya peeps, I'm Prakhar Nagpal! I'm a final year Computing student at Imperial
College London working on completing my thesis. I'm developing a way to
transparently migrate distributed applications hosted on a new serverless
runtime, [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm). I took a year off to work as a software
engineer at a company working on building a testing and tooling platform for self-driving
cars.

I enjoy working on projects involving compilers, operating systems, databases, distributed
systems, and hacking on emulators/assemblers. I love learning about programming language
design and type theory. Recently I've gotten into building web applications and design. In the
free time I'm working through all the books recommended at
[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com), and I just recently
picked up [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things).

Outside of work and school, I love playing badminton, running (I recently ran my first 5K), listening to all sorts of music
(I've listed down my favorite artists and bands [here](/dump/music)), cooking
(favorite recipes and food stories [here](/dump/food)), walking and cycling around London (I might add a Strava integration here soon).
