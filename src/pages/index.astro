    <h1>A quick introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Hiya peeps, I'm Prakhar Nagpal! I'm a final year Computing student at Imperial
      College London working on completing my thesis. I'm developing a way to
      transparently migrate distributed applications hosted on a new serverless
      runtime, <a href="https://github.com/faasm/faasm">Faasm</a>. I took a year off to work as a software
      engineer at a company working on building a testing and tooling platform for self-driving
      cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working on projects involving compilers, operating systems, databases, distributed
      systems, and hacking on emulators/assemblers. I love learning about programming language
      design and type theory. Recently I've gotten into building web applications and design. In the
      free time I'm working through all the books recommended at
      <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com">Teach Yourself Computer Science</a>, and I just recently
      picked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">
        The Design of Everyday Things
      </a>
