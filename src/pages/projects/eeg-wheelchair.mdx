I joined the Neurotech society at Imperial this year and we've started working on a really cool project
to allow people with physical disabilities to control a wheelchair wearing an EEG headset. I'll be writing
about all of the things we try and figure out along the way, as well as the background that you need to know
to understand what's going on. It's a really great introductory project for anyone interested in neurotechnology.
