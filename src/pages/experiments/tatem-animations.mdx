Sometime this week I was scrolling through Godly's collections of websites
(as one does on a day with nothing better to do) which is where I stumbled
across [Tatem](https://tatem.com). It has a bunch of really beautiful scroll
animations and I thought it'd be fun to recreate some of them!

This first one was super tricky to figure out, getting `getScrollYProgress` to
work without any content below is much much harder than I thought it would be.
