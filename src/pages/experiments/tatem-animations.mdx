import TatemScroll from "../../components/experiments/tatemScroll.jsx";

Sometime this week I was scrolling through Godly's collections of websites
(as one does on a day with nothing better to do) which is where I stumbled
across [Tatem](https://tatem.com). It has a bunch of really beautiful scroll
animations and I thought it'd be fun to recreate some of them!

This is the first one. It highlights the label depending on the users scroll
position.
